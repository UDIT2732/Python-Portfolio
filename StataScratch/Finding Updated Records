Finding Updated Records  https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/10299-finding-updated-records?tabname=question

We have a table with employees and their salaries, however, some of the records are old and contain 
outdated salary information. Find the old salary of each employee assuming that salaries increase each year. 
Output their id, first name, last name, department ID, and old salary. Order your list by employee ID in descending order.


DataFrame: ms_employee_salary

id:int64
first_name:object
last_name:object
salary:int64
department_id:int64

import pandas as pd

e = ms_employee_salary
e.groupby('id',as_index = False).max()
