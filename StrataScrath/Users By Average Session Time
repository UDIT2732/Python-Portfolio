Calculate each user's average session time. A session is defined as the time difference between a page_load and 
page_exit. For simplicity, assume a user has only 1 session per day and if there are multiple of the same events 
on that day, consider only the latest page_load and earliest page_exit. Output the user_id and their average session time.
